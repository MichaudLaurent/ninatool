The 'Nonlinear Inductive Network Analyzer' (NINA) tool is a python package to analyze superconducting circuits, based on the theory presented 
in the paper 'Hamiltonian extrema of an arbitrary Josephson circuit' (https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03155).

The main functionality of NINA is to compute the Tayolor expansion coefficient of the effective potential energy function of an arbitrary flux-biased superconducting loop.
The loop can host any combination of Josephson junctions (JJs) and linear inductances.

NINA includes a simple GUI to allow the user to quickly test the properties of a desired superconducting structure (branches and single loops are currently supported, more general structures will be available in the future).

If you use NINA for your research, be a good citizen and cite this article https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03155.
